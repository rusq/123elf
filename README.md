# Lotus 1-2-3 for Linux

This is a native port of Lotus 1-2-3 Release 3 to Linux. There's an article documenting how this is possible
[here](https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/linux123.html).

## Building

### Dependencies

First, you need a version of binutils that is compiled with `coff-i386` target
support. You can check like this:

```
$ objdump --info | grep coff-i386
```

> Note: Most distributions do not enable this for some reason.

Run the included `binutils.sh` to download and compile a version of binutils known to work for this.

Secondly, you need a copy of Lotus 1-2-3 for UNIX, you can download it
[here](https://archive.org/details/123-unix). Just place the raw disk images in 
the build directory and run `extract.sh`.

Finally, just run `make`.

#### Packages

The following packages are required

| Ubuntu              | Fedora              | Debian (bookworm)   | Ubuntu (bionic)
| ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------
| build-essential     | glibc-devel.i686    | build-essential     | build-essential
| gcc-multilib        | libgcc.i686         | gcc-multilib        | gcc-multilib
| lib32ncurses-dev    | ncurses-static.i686 | lib32ncurses-dev    | libncurses-dev:i386

## Installing

Run `make install` to install into `/usr/local`.

Run `make install prefix=/my/prefix` to install into a custom prefix.

Run `make uninstall` or `make uninstall prefix=/my/prefix` to uninstall.

## Running

Just run `./123` in the project directory after building, or, if you installed it, run `123`.

### Getting Started

There is a quick start guide in the wiki [here](https://github.com/taviso/123elf/wiki/Getting-Started), and the full manual can be seen here [here](https://archive.org/details/lotus-1-2-3-release-3.1-reference/Lotus%201-2-3%20Release%203.1%20-%20Tutorial).

There is a man page in `share/man/man1/123.1` that describes the command line options.

Lotus 1-2-3 has context sensitive online help, you can press <kbd>F1</kbd> at most times to see some hints.

> Note: You use the <kbd>/</kbd> key to open the 123 menu!

If you've used any spreadsheet before, you should be able to get started quickly. Functions use `@` instead of `=`, but the common functions like `@SUM`, `@AVG`, `@INDEX`, and even `@HLOOKUP` all work as you would expect.

## FAQ

- Q. How do I quit 123?

If the status indicator in the top right says `READY`, try `/Quit Yes`.

If it doesn't say `READY` (it might say `ERROR`, `HELP` `POINT`, `MENU` or
something else), try hitting <kbd>Esc</kbd> until it goes back to `READY`.

- Q. I get the error 'invalid compressed data--code out of range'.

You have a *very* old gzip with broken lzw/pack support. You can try running
the `gzip.sh` script to build a more recent gzip, then rerun the extract
script.

## Bugs

- ~~The keyboard map seems to be incomplete~~ (XTerm compatible terminals should be [working](https://github.com/taviso/123elf/wiki/Keybindings), please test others!)
- ~~Graphs don't work yet~~ (Partially working!, see [#5](https://github.com/taviso/123elf/issues/5)).
- ~~Printing doesn't work yet~~ (Print to file works, print to lpr is being worked on, see [#50](https://github.com/taviso/123elf/issues/50)).
- `STEP` mode does not display the current step (Nearly working! see [#101](https://github.com/taviso/123elf/issues/101)).
- There is limited i18n support (We're working on it, see [#73](https://github.com/taviso/123elf/issues/73)).
- File an issue if you notice something, there are probably lots of minor issues that can be fixed!

## Running the docker-compose image

```
docker compose run -i 123r3
